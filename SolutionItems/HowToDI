 How to decide how to register types in the container
 Rules:
      RF1: Functionality is the      same for each call                         - AddSingleton
      RF2: Functionality is the different for each request chain                - AddScoped
      RF2: Functionality is the      same for each call but need thread safety  - AddScoped
      RF3: Functionality is the different for each call                         - AddTransient

      RO1: Object members/properties are same      for every call         - AddSingleton
      RO2: Object members/properties are different for each request chain - AddScoped
      RO3: Object members/properties are different for every call         - AddTransient

      RD0: Dependency of the registering type isn't existing                            - AddSingleton
      RD1: Dependency of the registering type is with highest priority of AddSingleton  - AddSingleton
      RD2: Dependency of the registering type is with highest priority of AddScoped     - AddScoped
      RD3: Dependency of the registering type is with highest priority of AddTransient   - AddTransient

 Priority: AddTransient > AddScoped > AddSingleton

 Decision:
      1. Check based on functionality.
      2. Check based on members/properties.
      2. Check based on Type dependency.
      3. Register the new type with the highest priority of above
